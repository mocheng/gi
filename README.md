GitHub command line interactive tool made with NodeJS.

This project is inspired by gh which enables operaton github in command line. But, I found it is hard to memorize commands of gh. The goal of this project is to make it easier to play with github in command line.

## Dependencies

In order to run this project, you must have [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org) installed.
